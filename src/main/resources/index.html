                        <p>
                            On behalf of everyone at H&K, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for
                            joining us on the 10th Annual H&K National Ride from London to
                            Bournemouth last year! It was truly inspiring to see 150 riders come
                            together for this 120-mile journey, making that event one to
                            remember.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’re excited to share that, together, we raised over
                            <strong>£74,000</strong> to help build an education center in Mali, with
                            our charity partner, Muntada Aid. We are proud to announce
                            that the center has now been completed this year! This achievement would
                            not have been possible without your dedication and support, and we’re
                            thrilled to see our collective efforts making a lasting impact on
                            education and opportunity in the region.
                        </p>
